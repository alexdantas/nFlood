/** This file handles all color schemes of nCurses.
 *
 *  You can't do nothing with a single `color_t`.
 *  Color pairs (`color_pair_t`) are what you're looking for.
 *
 *  You can set a color pair, so that next texts you write on
 *  the screen will have their appearance.
 *
 *  Single colors only exist to build color pairs.
 *  See the functions on this module and how they fit together
 *  to build color pairs from colors.
 *
 *  Starting off, you have the following colors:
 *
 *  `COLOR_BLACK`
 *  `COLOR_RED`
 *  `COLOR_GREEN`
 *  `COLOR_YELLOW`
 *  `COLOR_BLUE`
 *  `COLOR_MAGENTA`
 *  `COLOR_CYAN`
 *  `COLOR_WHITE`
 *  `COLOR_DEFAULT`  (default color of your terminal)
 *
 *  You can combine them as foreground and background to
 *  make color pairs.
 *  Also, you can create your own RGB colors with
 *  `color_rgb` and `color_hex`.
 *
 *  @note `COLORS` is nCurses' alias for the maximum number of
 *        currently supported colors.
 *        For old terminals that's 8 and for modern ones is 256.
